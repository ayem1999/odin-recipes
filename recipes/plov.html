    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Many are afraid to cook plov - it turns out to be porridge, then dry, then too watery. In addition, the gurus of Uzbek cuisine like to talk about it in a long, ornate way and with a lot of restrictions.</p>
    <p>It seems that cooking pilaf is more difficult than controlling a spaceship. It's not like that at all! Pilaf is a simple meal. And pilaf is prepared easily and simply! Without any show-offs and problems!</p>
