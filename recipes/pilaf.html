    <h1>Pilaf Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/plov.jpg" alt="Pilaf">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Many are afraid to cook pilaf - it turns out to be porridge, then dry, then too watery. In addition, the gurus of Uzbek cuisine like to talk about it in a long, ornate way and with a lot of restrictions.</p>
    <p>It seems that cooking pilaf is more difficult than controlling a spaceship. It's not like that at all! Pilaf is a simple meal. And pilaf is prepared easily and simply! Without any show-offs and problems!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat (chicken, lamb, etc.) - 1 kg</li>
        <li>Rice (long-grain steamed or other rice) - 1 kg</li>
        <li>v</li>
        <li>Onion - 4 pcs</li>
        <li>Garlic - 2 heads</li>
        <li>Fresh hot pepper - 2 pods</li>
        <li>Cumin or other spices - to taste</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil - 250-300 ml</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We prepare all the products for pilaf.
            Cut the meat into pieces.</li>
        <li>Onions are cut into cubes, carrots - rather large cubes.</li>
        <li>In a heated cauldron, lightly fry the onion in vegetable oil.</li> 
        <li>Add the meat, fry until almost ready.</li>   
        <li>We put the carrots to sleep, fry them. Salt, add spices.</li>
        <li>We wash the rice well, put it in a cauldron, mix it and pour boiling water so that the water covers the rice by 2-2.5 cm.
            It is better to keep the water short. If during the cooking process it turns out that there is not enough water, you can safely add it. But if there is a lot of water, the rice is guaranteed to be digested.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil without covering with a lid. We try for salt and add salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>As soon as it boils, add whole garlic heads, peeled from the top husk, and hot pepper pods.
            Reduce the heat to a minimum, cover with a lid and leave the pilaf for 20 minutes.
            After 20 minutes, check: if the rice is still raw and there is no more water, add some hot water and cover again. The finished rice should not be too soft.</li>
        <li>Turn off the fire and let the pilaf stand for 15-20 minutes.</li>  
        <li>Traditionally, Achuchuk salad (Achik-Chuchuk or, otherwise, Shakarob) is prepared for Uzbek pilaf. It is elementary to cook it: cut tomatoes and onions, add salt and black pepper. Oil is not added to this salad.</li>  
        <li>The pilaf is ready! Enjoy your meal!</li>
    </ol>
